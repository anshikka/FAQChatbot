# FAQChatbot
Using Python and NLTK, I created a chatbot that utilizes cosine similarity to answer basic cars.com FAQ questions.

To run the code, create a directory "data" and place the carscom.txt file in the data folder. Make sure all dependencies are satisfied for NLTK, scikit-learn, and NumPy. Run the code!
